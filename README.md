# Neural Mechanisms of Influence and Message Propagation - Pre-Registered Hypotheses Results

This page holds the analysis for pre-registered hypotheses for the project titled Neural Mechanisms of Influence and Message Propagation. The pre-registered hypotheses, as well as more information about the project, can be found on the Open Science Foundation website:

Study 1: https://osf.io/aci6b/<br>
Study 2: https://osf.io/4srw5/

This page will be continuously updated as more hypotheses are tested. Please refer to [hypotheses.md](hypotheses.md) file for a summary table of the hypotheses that have been tested to date. The table includes links to individual scripts showing how the analyses were conducted, as well as their results. Results should be interpreted with the specific analyses techniques we used in mind, as we recognize that some of the hypotheses are broad enough to be tested with various different types of models and approaches.

Please note that the large number of pre-registstered hypotheses reflects that each part of this study included two separate scanner tasks and involved multiple researchers and research interests.
