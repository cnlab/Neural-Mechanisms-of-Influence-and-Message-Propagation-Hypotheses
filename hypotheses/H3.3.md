<td><strong>H3.3</strong>: The higher a participant’s score on the interdependence subscale of the self-construal scale, the stronger the activation in the mentalizing system and the more self-other overlap in the ventral-dorsal gradient of self/other-related MPFC activation when making sharing decisions in the Sharing Task (Contrast: Sharing vs. no sharing conditions).</td>

Results

### ROI Results

-   We extracted activity in the mentalizing ROI, which was defined by searching the reverse-inference map on Neurosynth (Yarkoni, Poldrack, Nichols, Van Essen, & Wager, 2011) database using the term ‘mentalizing', identifying regions to be associated with mentalizing activity in 124 published neuroscience studies. ![](img/neurosynth_ment.png)

-   Activity in this ROI was extracted for the main contrast of interest: sharing (broad- and narrowcasting) &gt; non-sharing (self and topic).
-   Then, we conducted linear regressions to determine if activity in the mentalizing ROI was associated with individuals' interdepdence subscale score from the self-construal scale.

### Whole Brain Results

-   Here are the whole brain results of the contrast: <strong>sharing (broad- and narrowcasting) &gt; non-sharing (self and topic)</strong> with a multi-level regression of interdependence scores. No significant clusters survived FDR correction at p=.05.
-   Here are exploratory results at p&lt;.005; k=5 that include clusters in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, striatum, and cerebellum. ![](img/H3_3_SCS_Inter_SHAREvsNONSHARE.png) ![](img/H3_3_SCS_Inter_SHAREvsNONSHARE_2.png)
