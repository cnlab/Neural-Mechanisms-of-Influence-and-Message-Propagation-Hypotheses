<td><strong>H2.3</strong>: The higher a participant's score on the resistance to peer influence and/or the lower their score on the susceptibility to peer pressure scale, the lower the activation in the mentalizing system while reading article abstracts and while making sharing decisions in Phase 2 of the Sharing Task (Contrasts: sharing vs. no sharing conditions).</td>

### ROI Results

-   We extracted activity in the mentalizing ROI, which was defined by searching the reverse-inference map on Neurosynth (Yarkoni, Poldrack, Nichols, Van Essen, & Wager, 2011) database using the term â€˜mentalizing', identifying regions to be associated with mentalizing activity in 124 published neuroscience studies. ![](img/neurosynth_ment.png)

-   Activity in this ROI was extracted for the main contrast of interest: sharing (broad- and narrowcasting) &gt; non-sharing (self and topic)
-   Then, we conducted linear regressions to determine if activity in the mentalizing ROI was associated with individuals' 1) resistance to peer influence (RPI) and 2) susceptibility to peer pressure (SPP)

<strong>1) Resistance to Peer Influence (RPI):</strong><br>

    ## lm(formula = SHAREvsNONSHARE_reading ~ rpi, data = df_combined_ment)

### Whole Brain Results

-   Here are the whole brain results of the contrast: <strong>sharing (broad- and narrowcasting) &gt; non-sharing (self and topic)</strong> with a multi-level regression of resistance to peer influence scores. No significant clusters survived FDR correction at p=.05.
-   Here are exploratory results at p&lt;.005; k=5 that include clusters in the caudate, insula, and precentral gyrus. ![](img/H1_1_ego_betweenness_gDIFF_vs_NR.png) ![](img/H1_1_ego_betweenness_gDIFF_vs_NR_2.png)
